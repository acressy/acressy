# Hi, I'm Abby Cressy! 👋

## About Me
Hey! I'm a 4th-year Biology major at Georgia Tech, graduating in May 2025 (GO JACKETS!🐝). 
I'm passionate about genomics, bioinformatics, and understanding how computational tools can enhance biomedical research. Currently, I'm investigating patterns of ribonucleotides (rNMPs) in genomic DNA and their potential biological implications as part of my course-based senior research.

## What I'm Working On 👩‍🔬
- **Research**: Analyzing ribonucleotide patterns in genomic DNA to uncover trends and biological significance.
- **STEM Outreach**: Organizing STEM activity kits and events for kids at local libraries and elementary schools.
- **Running Goals**: Training to run a 10k by July 4th, 2025!

## Skills & Interests 🧬💻
- **Bioinformatics**: R, Python (pandas, matplotlib), mySQL
- **Data Analysis**: Genomic sequence analysis, machine learning basics, RNA-seq
- **Wet Lab Experience**: Cell culture, PCR, qPCR, magnetic bead purification, BSCII safety
- **Science Communication**: Teaching, outreach, and making STEM accessible

## Fun Facts 🎉
- I studied abroad in Barcelona in Fall 2022 and took Organic Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Human Anatomy abroad!
- Former Mathnasium tutor (2020-2022) and Biology TA at Georgia Tech (Fall 2024).
- As a prospective MS Bioinformatics student, I have already taken 5/12 of my required graduate courses and got them paid for with my Zell Miller Scholarship!

Looking forward to collaborating and learning new things together!
