# Hi, I'm Abby Cressy! 👋

## About Me
Hey! I'm an incoming bioinformatics master's student Georgia Tech, graduating in May 2026 (GO JACKETS!🐝).
I am currently in the final stretch of the 5-year B.S. Biology/M.S. Bioinformatics program and just graduated with my bachelor's in biology in May 2025.
My research interests include clinical bioinformatics and cancer genomics. However, I am always ready to learn about new research topics and soak it up like a sponge!

## What I'm Working On 👩‍🔬
- **Research**: As part of my senior research lab this past spring, I worked to analyze ribonucleotide incorporation patterns within the genomic DNA of _Sacharomyces cerevisea_ in order to understand more about the impact of rNMP incorporation on DNA as well as any biases that might be present.
- **STEM Outreach**: I have been co-president of a club called Little Einsteins since Fall 2024. Our mission is to encourage a love for STEM in the Atlanta area, specifically for students K-5. Each semester we create 700+ STEM activity kits for kids at local libraries and help host STEM activities at local Title I elementary schools.
- **Learning Outside of the Classroom**: Currently working on the Rosalind Project problems to try and build on my programming skillset before starting my master's in bioinformatics this fall.
- **Running Goals**: I just ran the Peachtree Road Race (10k) in July 2025! I am currently going on runs just for fun but I am looking for a new race to run soon :)

## Skills & Interests 🧬💻
- **Bioinformatics**: R, Python (pandas, matplotlib), MySQL
- **Data Analysis**: Genomic sequence analysis, machine learning basics, RNA-seq
- **Wet Lab Experience**: Cell culture, PCR, qPCR, magnetic bead purification, BSCII safety
- **Science Communication**: Teaching, outreach, and making STEM accessible

## Fun Facts 🎉
- I studied abroad in Barcelona in the Fall of 2022 and took Organic Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Human Anatomy.
- Former Mathnasium tutor (2020-2022) and Biology TA at Georgia Tech (Fall 2024).
- As a prospective MS Bioinformatics student, I have already taken five of my required graduate courses and got them paid for with my Zell Miller Scholarship!
- I love to crochet! So far, my favorite project is the blanket I made in the shape of Captain America's shield.
